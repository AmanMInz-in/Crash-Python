name=("aman minz")
print(name.title())

# we also have another style to do it
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
# through the above code we can see that in upper every letter is in uppercase
# in lower case every letter is in lower case in my system

# here what it does is thet it see this as a name and automatically makes the first 
# letter capital
